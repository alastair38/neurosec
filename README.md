##Neurosec##

This theme integrates elements of Google's Material Design with Wordpress using the [Material CSS framework](http://materializecss.com/). The underlying file structure, bower and gulp support is indebted to Jeremy Englert's excellent [JointsWP](http://www.jointswp.com), although Bahamontes itself does not use any Foundation elements.

The theme takes is name from Federico Bahamontes, winner of the 1959 Tour de France and six-time King of the Mountains.

- Translation Support
- Bower and Gulp Support (thanks again to Jeremy Englert for this)
